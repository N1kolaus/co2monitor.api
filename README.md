# CO2 Monitor API

The CO2 Monitor API is a web application built using Go that allows you to receive and store CO2 and temperature readings from a CO2 monitor. The API enables the collection, storage, and retrieval of CO2 and temperature data for different rooms, allowing users to track environmental conditions over time. Instead of gin-gonic and GORM, the project will now run using the standard library of Go, while maintaining the same functionality.
